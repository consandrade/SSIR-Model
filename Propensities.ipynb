    "# Propensities for the SIR Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model, the propensities describe the rates at which transitions occur between different states (i.e., from susceptible to infected, and from infected to recovered). These propensities are based on parameters like the infection rate and recovery rate.\n",

    "The propensities are used in the Gillespie algorithm (stochastic simulation) to model the random transitions in the population over time. These rates determine how likely it is for a given event (infection or recovery) to occur at each step of the simulation.\n"
